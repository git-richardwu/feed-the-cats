# feed the cats

**Feed the Cats** is a game where players must prepare and deliver dishes to the feline overlords in accordance with their specific orders. It is a test of both the player's typing skills and mouse accuracy, as the primary gameplay loop involves typing out orders and dragging them to the corresponding patron. Serving the correct dish will grant the player extra time, while serving the incorrect dish will deduct time. The severity of the penalty increases with each subsequent mistake. Players must complete the orders as quickly and accurately as possible in order to survive as long as they can.
